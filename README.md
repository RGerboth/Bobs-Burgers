# Burger Order Desk
This is a simple order entry, state change and delete application. 

## Overview
This Burger Order Desk application is written in JavaScrip using jQuery and handlebars in an MVC structure with MySQL for data storage. The basic functionality includes the ability to add new items, change the state of an item (in this case from Not Eaten to Eaten), move the item to the appropriate display area based on state and to delete items. When doing this exercise Bob's Burgers popped into my head, hence the background and theme. This application could be easily extended to include different types of product input, multiple state changes and any theme appropriate for the specific application.  

Deployed on Heroku with JawsDB MySQL.
